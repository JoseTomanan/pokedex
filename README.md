# Pokédex in Svelte

This is a frontend project by Jose Tomanan that operates off of the [official PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2), to allow browsing of Pokémon, as well searching, sorting, and filtering by their ID number or name.

Keep reading below to see how to set up the environment and launch the server.

## Installing dependencies

If this is the first time you're opening this app, install dependencies using `npm ci` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`).

## Developing

Once you've installed dependencies, start a development server:

```sh
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of the app:

```sh
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

<!-- 
> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
